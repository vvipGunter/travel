             <center>Moment In life </center> <br/>
             <div id="div1">Maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back, Don't expect love in return;but if it does not,be content it grew in yours.</div>
     <div style="text-indent:2em;">It takes an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it  takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't rely on one's appearance ; it can deceive. Don't rely on wealth; even that fades away. Rely on someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them.Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to make you sweet enough trials to make you strong enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy.</div>
   <div style="text-indent:2em;">Always put yourself in others'shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts others, too. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the   most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness waits for those who cry, those who have been hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.</div>
  <div style="text-indent:2em;">The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past. You can't go on well in life until you let your past failures and heartaches go off. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.</div>
